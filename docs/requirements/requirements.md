# Requirements Document: OCRix - Privacy-First Document Scanner & Search App (Flutter/Dart)

## 1. Project Overview

Design and implement a cross-platform document scanner and organizer app in Flutter/Dart. The app must extract text from images via on-device OCR, store documents and metadata with flexible provider selection, and enable ultra-fast local or remote search. Users will have granular control over where metadata and files are stored (local/offline or cloud providers like Google Drive, OneDrive). Privacy and security are foundational; users can operate completely offline or enable selective sync.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Document Capture and OCR

-   Ability to capture images via camera or import from gallery/files.
-   Perform on-device OCR (using ML Kit on Android, Vision on iOS) to extract text from documents.
-   Preview scanned docs and allow user edits to the extracted text before saving.

### 2.2. Metadata Extraction and Editing

-   Automatically record scan date, device, confidence score, detected language.
-   Allow users to categorize docs (type: e.g., receipt, contract, manual, invoice) and add custom tags.
-   Store additional editable metadata (notes, location, etc.).

### 2.3. Storage Provider Selection (Per-Type)

-   User selects preferred storage for metadata (Local SQLite, Google Drive, OneDrive, future extensibility).
-   User selects preferred storage for files (images/PDFs): same options.
-   Mix-and-match: E.g., metadata local, files on Google Drive, etc.
-   User can change providers at any time; support migration/export/import of data between providers.

### 2.4. Synchronization Logic

-   Offline mode: All core functionality (scan, browse, search) works without network or cloud.
-   If sync enabled, only selected data and documents are synced.
-   Background sync manager tracks unsynced items and uploads/downloads as permitted.
-   User can choose auto/manual sync intervals.
-   Provide feedback/status in UI for sync: last synced, pending, success/error.

### 2.5. Search and Browse

-   Powerful full-text search (local FTS SQLite and/or cloud provider cache when offline).
-   Search and filter by metadata (date, type, tags), keywords in extracted text, or combinations.
-   Fast response time: Instant/near-instant for local, reasonable for remote.
-   Browse scanned documents by folder/category/type.

### 2.6. Security and Privacy

-   Encryption at rest for all local data and files (AES-256).
-   Encryption in transit for all network/cloud sync.
-   OAuth2 for connecting cloud providers; do not store tokens unencrypted.
-   Privacy audit log: Users can see when/where each file/metadata item was stored, synced, deleted, and exported.
-   Permission model: Data never leaves device without explicit user approval.
-   Ability for users to permanently delete local or remote files/metadata; complete "right to erasure".

### 2.7. User Controls and Settings

-   Provider selection screens for metadata and file storage â€“ flexible, granular controls.
-   Sync controls (auto/manual/per-item/per-type/global).
-   Data migration wizard for moving between providers.
-   Export/import function for bulk data movement or backups.
-   Notification and status dashboard for sync/errors/security actions.

### 2.8. Monetization and Extensibility

-   Core scanning, OCR, and basic organization features are free.
-   Premium features (offered by subscription/in-app purchase):
    -   Multiple cloud provider integration.
    -   AI-driven metadata extraction/categorization.
    -   Bulk export/import.
    -   Privacy/security audits.
    -   Advanced analytics and organization tools.
-   Easy API extension points for future 3rd-party provider integration (Dropbox, Box, etc.).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Performance

-   Scans and searches must be responsive even with 1,000+ docs.
-   Sync operations must not block UI; always async with error states.
-   Memory and storage usage optimized for older devices as well as new.

### 3.2. Reliability

-   Local database must not corrupt even in power loss; use transactions.
-   Sync must ensure consistency across providers, prevent duplication.
-   Robust error handling and user feedback.

### 3.3. Privacy and Security

-   Source code must be auditable; no analytics or data tracking baked in.
-   All sensitive user data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
-   Password/biometrics can optionally protect app access.

### 3.4. Extensibility

-   All provider logic must be modular for future cloud or local targets.
-   Data schema and export/import logic documented and versioned.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1. Platform

-   Flutter/Dart for both Android and iOS.

### 4.2. Database

-   Local: Encrypted SQLite DB for metadata; local encrypted file store for images.
-   Cloud: Modular connectors for Google Drive, OneDrive with ability to store metadata and/or files.

### 4.3. OCR Library

-   Use ML Kit (Android) and Apple Vision (iOS) for text extraction.

### 4.4. Sync Engine

-   Background process to monitor changes, queue sync tasks, and manage conflicts or reverts.

### 4.5. Security Logic

-   Encryption libraries for DB and files must be state-of-the-art.
-   OAuth2 or secure API login for provider integrations.
-   Audit log stored (encrypted) locally.
